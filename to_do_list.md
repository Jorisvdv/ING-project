# Possible Adjustments:
[ ] Now we download all files, can we narrow that down to the selected simulation based on the name?
[ ] Introduce different types of errors
1.	Also do a type of error where connection between servers is severed.
2.	Infinite loop
3.	Connection break
4.	A falty patch, anomaly processed within 10 seconds at the place of 1 seconds after update.
[ ] Finalise plotly drop down selection
[ ] Add latency to logs and visualisation
[ ] Add crash and restart when memory overload
[ ] Add timeout error (with appropriate logger level)
[ ] Add error introduction (with seperate logger (see Manual_Error_Log.csv))
