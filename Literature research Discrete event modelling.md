**This paper seems very useful for the study that we are trying to perform.**

This paper is concerned with the design of a Bayesian network structure that is suitable for operational risk modelling. The model's structure is designed specifically from the perspective of a business unit operational risk manager whose role is to measure, record, predict, communicate, analyse and control operational risk within their unit.

The problem domain modelled is a functioning structured finance operations unit within a major Australian bank.
The network model design incorporates a number of existing human factor frameworks to account for human error and operational risk events within the domain. The design also supports a modular structure, allowing for the inclusion of many operational loss event types, making it adaptable to different operational risk environments.

This last paragraph is intriguing since we want to model a banking system where many potential events could occur and need to be taken into consideration. The problems that they encountered are:

- Payments made to incorrect beneficiaries, and/or for an incorrect amount, and/or for an incorrect value date. 
- Regulatory breach such as regulatory reporting or account segregation.
- Failure to enforce its rights or meet its obligations to counterparties over the life of a deal. 
- Exposure capture. This is the risk that the terms of a transaction or details of a counterparty /security are not recorded accurately in the Bank's systems, resulting in a misunderstanding of the risk profile.
